    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "/// A function is like a miniprogram within a program.\n",
    "A major purpose of functions is to group code that gets executed multiple times. Without a function defined, you would have to copy and paste this code each time\n",
    "In general, you always want to avoid duplicating code because if you ever decide to update the code—if, for example, you find a bug you need to fix—you’ll have to remember to change the code everywhere you copied it.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you get more programming experience, you’ll often find yourself deduplicating code, which means getting rid of duplicated or copy-and-pasted code. Deduplication makes your programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function execute: when the function is defined or when the function is called?\n",
    "\n",
    "/// The code in a function executes when the function is called - NOT when it is defined\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "def\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is the code that performs something and a function call is the code that triggers the function\n",
    "When a function is called with arguments - the code inside the brackets of the functionName('argumentcall') - the arguments are stored in the parameters - def functionName(parameter) # top line of function\n",
    "\n",
    "One special thing to note about parameters is that the value stored in a parameter is forgotten when the function returns. This variable is destroyed after the first function call\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "1 global scope and multiple (unlimited?) local scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "They are discarded\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is a return value? Can a return value be part of an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the function. The value that a function call evaluates to is called the return value of the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a function using the def statement, you can specify what the return value should be with a return statement. A return statement consists of the following:\n",
    "-The return keyword\n",
    "-The value or expression that the function should return\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The None Value - the absence of a value. The None value is the only value of the NoneType data type. (Other programming languages might call this value null, nil, or undefined.) Just like the Boolean True and False values, None must be typed with a capital N.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How can you force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the global statement\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "The None value is the only value of the NoneType data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the import areallyourpetsnamederic statement do?\n",
    "\n",
    "It imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic - which isn't a real Python module\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a function named bacon() in a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "This function could be called with: spam.bacon()\n",
    "\n",
    "13. How can you prevent a program from crashing when it gets an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Place the line of code that might cause an error in a try clause. Using the Try and Except clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What goes in the try clause? What goes in the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that could potentially cause an error goes in the try clause. The code that executes if an error happens goes in the except clause."
